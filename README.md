# Covid-API-Backend
A restful API to store and fetch covid data for different countries
this project was originally the final exam of my Fall 2021 Internet Engineering course at SBU.
this backend API could be coupled with [react covid tracker](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/React-Covid-Tracker) to create a full stack api.
